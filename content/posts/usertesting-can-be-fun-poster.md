We wanted to make sure that folks who prefer a 'static' resource for the 'User testing can be fun: An FAQ for small open source teams' can have access to the insights and advice too, which is why we made a poster for download and sharing as a digital resource or printing to put up in a workspace. 

The poster version doesn't require an internet connection to play (like the ['User testing can be fun: An FAQ interactive guide](https://sprblm.github.io/devs-guide-to/posts/user-testing-can-be-fun/)') as we recognise that not everyone globally has access to a stable connection all of the time and might just want a 'static' version of the FAQ tips and advice.

[You can download the high res .pdf hosted on our github repository here](https://github.com/sprblm/usable-user-testing-can-be-fun-poster)

Whereas you can fork, clone, edit, play and submit improvements via issues and PRs to the game's repository of code ([like the interactive guide has here](https://github.com/sprblm/usable-user-testing-can-be-fun)), the poster version can be iterated on and collaborated on in a similar way using an open ['PenPot'](https://penpot.app/) file. Simply upload a 'finished' version of your remixed poster via a pull request to our [repository for the 'Usertesting can be fun: An FAQ for small open source teams' poster](https://github.com/sprblm/usable-user-testing-can-be-fun-poster).
